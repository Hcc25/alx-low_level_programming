#this is a readme on Bit Manipulation

This project is focused on bit manipulation in the C programming language. 
The objective is to understand how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators to perform different tasks.
The project has two mandatory tasks, and the goal is to achieve a score of 100% on each one.
The first task is to write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. 
The function should receive a pointer to a string of 0 and 1 chars and should return the converted number. 
The function should return 0 if there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1 or if b is NULL.
